# Explore-National-Parks

#use cases
  I built this website so that park lovers everywhere can look up the basic infomation about our National Parks.
  It provides the basic information about the park and also a quick picture of the park as well.
  
  #How to
  To use my website you can use the drop down menu to select a state.  After selecting a state and hitting submit. The website will draw on the API and provide the data from the state you selected.
  After that you can select a favorite from the list.  Favoriting a website will then save it.
  You can then navigate to the favorite page and That will be an easy way to provide a quick view of the information for your favorite National Park.
